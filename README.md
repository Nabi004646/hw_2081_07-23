🧠 How It Works

1. HTML provides the structure with <audio> and <video> tags.


2. CSS styles everything — adding glow effects, gradients, and responsive layout.


3. JavaScript adds interactivity:

Toggles play/pause buttons.

Updates icons dynamically (▶ → ⏸).

Pauses one player when the other starts.
